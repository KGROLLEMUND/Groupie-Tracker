### Objectives  ### 
Groupie Trackers consists on receiving a given API and manipulate the data contained in it, in order to create a site, displaying the information.
It will be given an API, that consists in four parts:

The first one, artists, containing information about some bands and artists like their name(s), image, in which year they began their activity, the date of their first album and the members.

The second one, locations, consists in their last and/or upcoming concert locations.

The third one, dates, consists in their last and/or upcoming concert dates.

And the last one, relation, does the link between all the other parts, artists, dates and locations.

It should be used at least the artists and the relation parts given in the API.

Given all this you should build a user friendly website where you can display the bands info through several data visualizations (examples : blocks, cards, tables, list, pages, graphics, etc). It is up to you to decide which info you will present and how you will display it.

This project also focuses on the creation of events and on their visualization.

An event consists in a system that responds to some kind of action triggered by the client, time, or any other factor.
This project will help you learn about :

Manipulation and storage of data.
JSON files and format.
HTML.
Event creation and display.
Events.
